# üöÄ Karma AI Reward System

The **Karma Surprise Box** is an AI-driven reward microservice built with Python, FastAPI, and Docker. It evaluates user activity metrics (e.g., login streaks, posts created, upvotes received) and awards karma points based on predefined rules or a random mystery reward. The system assigns rarities (common, rare, legendary) to rewards and includes validation to reject invalid inputs (e.g., negative metrics).

This project is designed to incentivize user engagement on a platform by delivering surprise rewards, logged and tracked via a SQLite database.
